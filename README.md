These projects are my collection of projects from CS010C at the University of California, Riverside. They were completed during my first year as a Computer Science major and showcase my continued development in C++. This course focused on advanced data structures and algorithms, and the projects reflect hands-on experience with trees, graphs, recursion, and object-oriented programming.

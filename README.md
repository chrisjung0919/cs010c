This is a collection of my projects from CS010C at UC Riverside, completed during my first year as a Computer Science major. The class focused on data structures and algorithms, so these projects gave me a lot of hands-on experience with things like trees, graphs, and recursion. Each project helped me get more comfortable with C++ and taught me how to think more critically about how code works behind the scenes.
